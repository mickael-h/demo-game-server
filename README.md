### Symbol Values
The slot machine uses the following symbols with their respective values:
- üçí (Cherry): 2x
- üçä (Orange): 3x
- üçã (Lemon): 4x
- üçá (Grapes): 5x
- 7Ô∏è‚É£ (Seven): 10x
- üíé (Diamond): 20x

### Win Types and Payouts
- **Three of a Kind**: All three symbols match
  - Payout: bet amount √ó symbol value
- **Two of a Kind**: Two symbols match
  - Payout: bet amount √ó symbol value √ó 0.2
- **No Win**: All symbols are different
  - Payout: 0

### Weight System
The game uses a weight system to control probabilities:

1. **Outcome Weights**: Control the probability of different win types
   - Each weight must be a positive number
   - Weights are typically kept between 0 and 1
   - Higher weights increase the probability of that outcome
   - Weights are relative to each other

2. **Symbol Weights**: Control the probability of each symbol appearing
   - Each weight must be a positive number
   - Weights are typically kept between 0 and 1
   - Higher weights increase the probability of that symbol
   - Weights are relative to each other

### Example Requests
